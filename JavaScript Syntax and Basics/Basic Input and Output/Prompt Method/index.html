<!--
The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user to input some text. 
It returns the user's input as a string. If the user clicks "Cancel," it returns null.
message (optional): The text to display in the prompt box.
default (optional): The default value in the input field.
This code prompts the user to enter their name, and then greets them using that name.

Key Differences:
alert() is just for showing a message.
prompt() asks the user for input and returns their response.
confirm() asks for confirmation and returns true or false based on the user's choice.
These methods are very basic and often considered intrusive in modern web applications, 
so they are generally avoided in favor of custom modal dialogs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.
