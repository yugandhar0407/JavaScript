alert()
The alert() method is used to display a message to the user in a simple dialog box with an "OK" button. 
It doesn't return anything; its sole purpose is to show information.

When called, this will display a message saying "This is an alert box!" in a popup with an "OK" button. 
The user has to click "OK" to close the box and continue.
