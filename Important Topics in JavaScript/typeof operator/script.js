//  typeof() operator in javascript

//The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.

//In JavaScript, null is a primitive value. However, typeof returns "object". This is a well-known bug in JavaScript and has historical reasons.

let name = "Yugandhar";

console.log(typeof(name));

let num = 123456;

console.log(typeof(num));

let order = true;
console.log(typeof(order));
